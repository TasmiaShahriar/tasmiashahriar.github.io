I am a PhD Candidate in the department of Computer Science from North Carolina State University (NCSU), expecting to graduate in summer 2024. I joined the <a href='https://www.ieclab.org/'> IEC Lab </a>, supervised by <a href='https://noborumatsuda.github.io/'>Dr. Noboru Matsuda</a> in 2019.

My research interest lies at the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods, with a particular emphasis on integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) to promote equitable education through Intelligent Tutoring Systems. I am passionate about understanding the unique challenges learners face due to cognitive, racial, cultural, economic, and other social factors. By leveraging data mining, data analytics, and learning sciences, I aim to create solutions to address these challenges and improve educational outcomes for all students.

I am currently involved in the <a href='https://www.simstudent.org/home'> SimStudent project.</a> SimStudent is a teachable agent that utilizes inductive logic programming to learn from students' demonstrations. The project's goal is to facilitate students' learning by enabling them to teach the agent. My role focuses on generating contextually relevant questions to enhance students' critical thinking and improve their equation-solving skills as they engage in conversations with SimStudent.

Outside of work and studies, I love meeting new people and embracing diverse perspectives. I find joy in dancing, exploring new cultures, and discovering new hobbies. Whether through my work, studies, or interactions with others, I aim to live a life filled with purpose, positivity, and curiosity. I welcome anyone who wants to connect, share ideas, or simply enjoy a good conversation.
