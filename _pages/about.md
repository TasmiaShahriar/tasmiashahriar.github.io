I am a recent PhD graduate in Computer Science from North Carolina State University, graduated in August 12th, 2024. I joined the  <a href='https://www.ieclab.org/'> IEC Lab </a>, supervised by <a href='https://noborumatsuda.github.io/'>Dr. Noboru Matsuda</a>, in 2019.

My research focuses on developing AI methods, especially integrating NLP to promote equitable education through Intelligent Tutoring Systems. I am passionate about addressing the unique challenges learners face due to cognitive, racial, cultural, economic, and other social factors. By leveraging data mining, analytics, and learning sciences, I aim to create solutions that improve educational outcomes for all students.

Currently, I am involved in the<a href='https://www.simstudent.org/home'> SimStudent project.</a>, a teachable agent that uses inductive logic programming to learn from students' demonstrations. My role involves generating contextually relevant questions to enhance students' critical thinking and equation-solving skills during their interactions with SimStudent.

Outside of work, I enjoy meeting new people and embracing diverse perspectives. I find joy in dancing, exploring new cultures, and discovering new hobbies. Whether through my work or personal life, I aim to live with purpose, positivity, and curiosity and welcome anyone who wants to connect or share ideas.
