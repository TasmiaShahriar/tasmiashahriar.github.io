title: Itinerary Summarization with Temporal Information from Travelersâ€™ Blog
description: 
- The project is designed to generate summarized itineraries based on places and events extracted from traveller's blogs.
- We used named-entity and event extraction to identify places convered by the traveller in the particular blog.
- To differentiate between locations the traveler actually visited and those merely mentioned as memories or comparisons (e.g., "this place reminded me of..."), we used location-based tokenization. This method helps pinpoint which locations were visited during the current trip.
